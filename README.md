# ðŸ“Š Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL) â€“ DCF Valuation Model

This project presents a full-scale Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model for Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL), developed using Microsoft Excel. It forecasts future cash flows, calculates the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), and estimates intrinsic value to assess whether HUL is undervalued or overvalued compared to its market price.

## ðŸ§  Objective

- Estimate the intrinsic enterprise value of Hindustan Unilever Ltd. using a bottom-up valuation approach.
- Assess potential undervaluation or overvaluation versus current market price.
- Build a reusable and adaptable DCF model framework for other FMCG companies.

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

1. **Forecasting (FY25â€“FY30)**  
   - Regression-based projections for Sales, EBITDA, and Net Profit using historical financial data.
   - Conversion of operating profit to Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) using reinvestment rates.

2. **WACC Calculation**  
   - Cost of Equity estimated using the CAPM model.
   - Peer average beta and market risk premium assumed.
   - Capital structure assumptions applied to derive WACC.

3. **Terminal Value Estimation**  
   - Used the Gordon Growth Model with a **terminal growth rate of 5.38%**.
   - Final year FCFF extrapolated and discounted back using a **WACC of 12.24%**.

4. **Valuation Summary**  
   - Present Value of FCFF (5 years): â‚¹44,248 Cr  
   - Present Value of Terminal Value: â‚¹1,02,341 Cr  
   - **Enterprise Value (EV): â‚¹1,46,589 Cr**  
   - Indicates an estimated **~12% undervaluation** relative to current market price.
